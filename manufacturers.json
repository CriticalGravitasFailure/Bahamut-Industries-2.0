        "description": "Bahamut Industries is a strange organization; it arose from a mid-rim world that was festooned with ancient ruins. A small cult began on this world; it claimed to not worship any specific divinity, but used parables they had discovered on the world of the great protector Bahamut, some ancient figure on that world that was educator, protector, and caretaker--but supposedly a historical figure among those that lived there. The cult itself began a business, and using technology and plans scavenged from the world, began to produce mechs; a rather wide variety, but all... off from what one may expect, as suited for the descendants of such a strange, ancient lineage.Bahamut Industries itself focuses most of its profit, aside from expanding its manufacturing facilities, into spreading the word of the cult and doing good works projects on worlds in need. Some would suspect the corporation would only grant licenses to practicing members of the cult; that is untrue, though they DO come with a free subscription to their monthly newsletter and free simulcasting of services.",
